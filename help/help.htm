<h1>Advancedform_XH - a CMSimple_XH Plugin</h1>
<img src="../advancedform.png" width="128" height="128" alt="Plugin Icon" style="display: block; float: left">
<p>Advancedform_XH facilitates creating your own mail forms
for integration to CMSimple_XH.
It's possible use ranges from customized contact forms
to complex ordering or booking forms.
Even complex forms can be constructed by using the form editor,
so you don't have to write any HTML, CSS or PHP,
if the basic form functionality is enough for your needs.
Advanced customization is available through the template resp. hook system.</p>

<p><strong>Please do read this documentation! Support might not be given otherwise.
It's generally a good idea to read the documentation,
<em>before</em> you encounter any problems!</strong></p>

<h2><a name="notice">Important Notice</a></h2>
<p><strong>Advancedform_XH couldn't be tested so far in various environments.
It is a so called BETA version. Use with caution!</strong></p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2><a name="requirements">Requirements</a></h2>
<p>Advancedform_XH is a plugin for CMSimple_XH.
It requires a UTF-8 encoded version.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2><a name="installation">Installation</a></h2>
<p>The installation is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins.
See the <a href="http://www.cmsimple-xh.com/wiki/doku.php/manuals:users_manual:plugins:installation">
CMSimple_XH wiki</a> for further details.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Backup the data on your server.</strong></li>
<li>Unzip the distribution on your computer.</li>
<li>Upload the whole directory advancedform to your server into the CMSimple_XH plugins directory.</li>
<li>Set write permissions to the subdirectories config/, css/, languages/ and to the plugin's data folder.</li>
<li>Protect Advancedform_XH's data folder against direct access by any means your webserver provides.
.htaccess files for Apache servers are already distributed in the default data folder.
Note that the subfolders css/ and js/ must not deny public access.</li>
<li><strong>Switch to Advancedform in the back-end to check if all requirements are fulfilled.</strong></li>
</ol>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2><a name="settings">Settings</a></h2>
<p>The plugin's configuration is done as with many other
CMSimple_XH plugins in the website's back-end.
Select Advancedform from "Plugins".</p>
<p>You can change the default settings of Advancedform_XH in "Plugin Config".
Hints for the options will be displayed
when hovering over the help icon with your mouse.
The setting "php_extension" could provide additional security
with regard to the template and the hook system,
if set to "1".</p>
<p>Localization is done in "Plugin Language".
You can translate the character strings to your own language,
or customize them according to your needs.</p>
<p>The look of Advancedform_XH can be customized in "Plugin Stylesheet".
The upper part contains the styling of the forms displayed in the front-end.
The mail form is displayed as a table with two columns.
The left column shows the labels, the right colum the fields.
You can simply adjust the styles for the classes
"div.advfrm-mailform td.label" and "div.advfrm-mailform td.field".
You can style individual forms by selecting "form[name=FORM_NAME]",
and even individual fields by selecting "#advfrm-FORM_NAME-FIELD_NAME".
If you prefer a one column layout, you have to use the
<a href="#usage-templates">template system</a>.</p>
<p>The lower part of the stylesheet contains the styling of the mail form administration and the form editor.
If you want to style the property dialogs to fit to your template,
you should consider to add jQueryUI theming support to your template.
How this can be done is explained in the
<a href="http://www.cmsimpleforum.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=3435&start=2">CMSimple forum</a>.</p>
<p>Only the first part of the stylesheet above the line
<pre>/* END OF MAIL CSS */</pre>
will be included inline to sent HTML mails.
So put all style information that is appropriate for the mails to the top of stylesheet.css.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2><a name="usage">Usage</a></h2>

<h3><a name="usage-administration">Mail form administration</a></h3>
<p>In the back-end under Advancedform &rarr; "Mail Forms" you'll find the list of all defined mail forms.
You can add and import new forms and edit, delete, copy and export existing ones.
To the right of the mail form is the script code needed to show the according form on a page.
Just copy the code and paste it to the desired page.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h3><a name="usage-editor">Mail form editor</a></h3>
<p>The mail form editor allows you to construct your mail forms.
The details are explained in the following sections.</p>

and a confirmation mail with the sent information will be sent to him.</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Form fields</h4>
<p>In the lower part of the form editor you can edit the fields of the form.
Use the tool icons to add, delete or move fields.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>The name of the field may contain only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
It must be unique for all defined fields of the current form.
It is used to identify the field.</dd>

<dt>Output</dt>
<dd>A field to output arbitrary HTML.</dd>
<dt>Custom</dt>
<dd>A field, that is validated against a given regular expression.</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Field properties</h4>
<p>The field properties are edited in a dialog that could be opened by clicking
on the property icon.
The different field types have different properties that can be set.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Size</dt>
<dd>For text fields and such, the width of the field measured in characters.
For selectboxes the height of the list. Use 1 for a dropdown box.</dd>
<dt>Orientation</dt>
<dd>For radiobuttons and checkboxes only: whether these should be displayed horizontally or vertically.</dd>
<dt>Max. length</dt>
<dd>The maximum number of characters that can be entered.</dd>
<dt>Cols</dt>

<dd>For custom fields only: the regular expression the value should be checked against.</dd>
<dt>Error message</dt>
<dd>For custom fields only: the error message that should be displayed,
if the value doesn't match the regular expression.
Use <em>%s</em> to insert the label of the field to the message.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Radiobuttons, checkboxes and selectboxes allow to enter different options.
Use the tool buttons to add, delete and rearrange them.
The radiobuttons resp. checkboxes besides the options allow to specify these as default(s).
Use the tool "clear defaults" to reset them.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h3><a name="usage-form">Using the mail form</a></h3>
<p>Edit the page, that you want to display a mail form,
and insert the required script call: <pre>advancedform('FORM_NAME');</pre>
by CMSimple scripting, the {{{PLUGIN:...}}} call or by hi_pd_scripting.
It might be easiest to just copy&paste the necessary code from the mail form administration.</p>
<p>Now the mail form is ready to be used by the visitors of your site.
They can fill out the form and submit it.
If they make any mistakes, e.g. leaving empty an required field,
entering an invalid e-mail address or number
or specifying a file that is larger than allowed,
the form will be displayed again with the already entered input,
and with the errors shown above,
so the visitors can correct the mistakes and submit the form again.
It is not necessary that Javascript is enabled in the visitor's browser,
but if it is, the first erroneous field field will be focused,
and for date fields a date picker is available.
But none of the field validations relies on Javascript.</p>
<p>After successful submission of the form,
an e-mail will be sent to the receivers (To, CC and BCC) specified in the form editor.
Then the sent information is displayed to the visitor as confirmation,
or, if a thanks page is specified, the visitor will be redirected there,
and a confirmation mail will be sent to him.
The thanks page/confirmation feature will only work,
if a required field of type "Sender (e-mail)" is specified for the form.</p>
<p>It is even possible to have multiple Forms on a single page.
These could be sent independent from each other.
It is not clear, if this is an useful feature,
but however, it's possible.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h3><a name="usage-link">Replacing the built in mail form</a></h3>
<p>It is possible to replace CMSimple's built in mail form with a user defined
one. So just define the desired form, and enter its name in "Plugin Language" as
"contact form". Now CMSimple's mailform link will directly call your custom
form. Note, that an email address has to be configured for CMSimple_XH to
display the mailform link, but its value is completely ignored by
Advancedform_XH.</p>
<p>Alternatively create a hidden CMSimple page and insert the required script code to call the form.
Then you have to modify your template. Just replace
<pre>&lt;?php echo mailformlink()?&gt;</pre> with
<pre>&lt;?php echo advancedformlink('PAGE_URL')?&gt;</pre>
where PAGE_URL should be the part of the URL of the page after the ?.
It is possible to specify multiple advancedformlink()s this way.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h3><a name="usage-templates">Template system</a></h3>
<p>The template system allows to build highly customized mail forms.
Power users, who need to create or alter mail forms frequently,
might have a look at the
<a href="http://simplesolutions.dk/?Form_Mailer">Form Mailer</a>
by Jerry Jakobsfeld, which is even more versatile than Advancedform_XH.</p>
<p>If a file with the name FORM_NAME.tpl(.php) is found in Advancedform_XH's data folder,
it will be used as the template file.
Additionally the file css/FORM_NAME.css, if it exists, will be included as stylesheet
to the &lt;head&gt; section of the CMSimple_XH page and
the top of this stylesheet (delimited as for the plugin stylesheet) will be included to the e-mail.
And if a file js/FORM_NAME.js exists, it will be included into the page too.</p>
<p>You can write the template file and it's stylesheet manually,
but it might be easiest to let Advancedform_XH create a basic one
in the mail form administration.
By default the generated template files will display the form
similar to the original Advancedform's one column layout.
If that's all you want, you're done.</p>
<p>If you want to adjust the styling, have a look at the generated files.
In the template file you can see it's simplistic structure.
Everything is encapsulated within &lt;div&gt;s for flexibility.
Have a look at the class of the container-divs.
This is set to "break" by default, so every field will start in a new row.
Change it to "float" and the fields will be put right beside each other.
If you want to have the labels to the left of the fields,
just remove the comments in the prepared styles for div.label and div.field.</p>
<p>A template file is basically a PHP file with one addition to the syntax:
<pre>&lt;?field FIELD_NAME?&gt;</pre>
will output the field with the name FIELD_NAME.
Do not use any additional characters such as whitespace except a single space
between field and FIELD_NAME.
This notation is actually a shorthand for
<pre>&lt;?php echo Advancedform_displayField('FORM_NAME', 'FIELD_NAME')?&gt;</pre>
The template file will be evaluated in the context of CMSimple_XH,
so any global variables, constants and functions are available to use.
However, it is not possible to alter any global variables
(besides the superglobals, what might disturb the system's functioning).
And do not call non-existent functions as this will cause the PHP interpreter to fail.
<strong>Particularly you should be cautious using template files from untrusted sources,
as those could contain malicious code that might harm your CMSimple_XH installation.</strong></p>
<p>One particularly useful function might be
<pre>Advancedform_focusField($form_name, $field_name)</pre>
that will set the focus to the given field.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h3><a name="usage-hooks">Hooks</a></h3>
<p>The hooks are provided to give you even more flexibility, if you're able to write some PHP code.
Define them in a file FORM_NAME.inc(.php) in Advancedform_XH's data folder.
N.B.: this file will be include()'d, so it has to be encapsulated properly as PHP file.
The hooks will be called from Advancedform_XH on certain occassions.
They are not tied to the template system.</p>
<pre>function advfrm_custom_field_default($form_name, $field_name, $opt, $is_resent)</pre>
<p>This will be called before the form is sent to the browser.
It gives the opportunity to dynamically set default values for fields.
Just return the value you want to be used as the fields default value.
If you don't want to change the default value, just return NULL.
The third parameter is set for radiobuttons, checkboxes and selects only.
It contains the option, that is currently processed.
Return TRUE to check the option, FALSE to uncheck it,
or NULL to use whatever was specified in the form editor.
The parameter $is_resent tells whether the form was resent to the browser after submission,
because of validation errors. If this is the case the values already entered
by the user are sent back instead of the default values specified in the form editor.
You might consider to return NULL in this case, to not overwrite the users input.</p>
<pre>function advfrm_custom_valid_field($form_name, $field_name, $value)</pre>
<p>This will be called after the form was submitted, and gives the opportunity
to add additional validation to the field values.
Return TRUE, if the given $value is valid, otherwise return an error message,
which will be displayed to the user by Advancedform_XH.
For fields of type 'file', $value is the $_FILES[] array belonging to the given field.</p>
<pre>function advfrm_custom_mail($form_name, &$mail, $is_confirmation)</pre>
<p>This will be called after the $mail object is initialized with all information
and just before the mail is sent, and gives the opportunity
to alter the $mail object. The call-by-reference for $mail is
important for PHP4, and does no harm for PHP5.
The documentation for PHPMailer is not distributed with Advancedform_XH,
but it can be downloaded from
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpmailer/files/phpmailer%20for%20php4/PHPMailer%20v2.0.4%20for%20PHP4/PHPMailer_v2.0.4.zip/download">
Sourceforge</a>.
The parameter $form_name specifies the currently processed form,
and the parameter $is_confirmation specifies whether the $mail object contains
the information for the mail or the confirmation mail (i.e. the response).
If you want to suppress sending of the mail at all, just return FALSE.</p>
<pre>function advfrm_custom_thanks_page($form_name, $fields)</pre>
<p>This is called after the mail is sent, and can be utilized to switch to a
personalized thanks page.
Return the query string (i.e. the part of the URL of the page after the question mark) of the page you want to redirect to.
Returning an empty string will redirect to the thanks page that's defined in the form editor.
If no default thanks page is defined, the sent information will be displayed.
The parameter $fields is an array holding the values of all submitted form fields.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h3><a name="usage-demo">Demo forms</a></h3>
<p>You should have a look at the shipped demo forms (see data/README.txt for further details)
to see what can be done, and how it can be done.</p>
<p><strong>Caution:</strong> of course you're free to use the demo forms as base
for your own forms. But as most of the demo forms use the template resp. hook system,
the result might not be as expected. Either remove the unwanted template/hook files manually,
or make a copy of the form in the form administration and use this copy.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2><a name="limitations">Limitations</a></h2>

<h3>Sending of Mails fails</h3>
<p>If the sending of mails fails with the message
"Could not instantiate mail function",
that <em>might</em> be caused by your server prohibiting mails with CC and BCC addresses.</p>

<h3>jQuery</h3>
<p>Advancedform_XH <em>may</em> not work in installations
with jQuery dependent plugins/addons/templates that
don't use jQuery4CMSimple, but import their own jQuery library.
This won't get fixed (as it's not possible to fix it in all cases),
because all developers are advised to use only jQuery4CMSimple together
with all their jQuery based code for CMSimple_XH.
So offending extensions should be updated!</p>

<h3>Alternative mailers</h3>
<p>The original AdvancedForm supported different kinds of mailers.
IMO this is a rarely needed feature.
Most webhosters will provide the possibility to send mail via mail(),
which should be easily configured and quite acceptable for the purposes of Advancedform_XH.</p>

<h3>SPAM protection</h3>
<p>The original Advancedform offered several features regarding SPAM protection:
IP blacklists, a badword filter, a XSS detection facility.
I'm not quite sure if these mechanisms are really the best way of preventing SPAM.
So I have implemented none of them (besides rendering XSS harmless), but instead a CAPTCHA is available.
This is only a minimal text-based solution, but more comprehensive CAPTCHAs
could be used through an additional conforming CAPTCHA plugin.
AFAIK currently the only conforming CAPTCHA plugins are
<a href="http://3-magi.net/?CMSimple_XH/Recaptcha_XH">Recaptcha_XH</a> and
<a href="http://3-magi.net/?CMSimple_XH/Cryptographp_XH">Cryptographp_XH</a>.</p>
